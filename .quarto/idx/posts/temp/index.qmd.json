No matter where I am, it's always a great benchmark to compare against other restaurants.\n\nWhat is defining feature of the California burrito? Fries.\n\nAdding fries to a burrito elevates it to a whole other level; standard burritos just can't compare. Add in the rest of your favorite toppings, and you have a wonderful burrito in your hands - but it all starts with the fries.\n\nIt must also be noted that a classic California burrito will have carne asada as the meat. Other versions do exist (for example, replacing the carne asada with chicken makes it an Arizona burrito), but none can compete with a perfectly executed California burrito.\n\n### The Rankings\n\nAll that to say, there are very important things that can separate one California burrito from another.\n\nWithout further ado, here are my rankings for best California burritos I have ever had:  \n\n1.
