### I'm Back!

It's been a long while since I've posted, as lots has happened over the last couple of months.   

Most notably, I've moved to NYC from Carlsbad, CA (goodbye, beaches!), and settled in quite nicely. The city is fantastic, and I am enjoying catching up with friends in the area!

### What's next?

Over the next little while, I plan to post every so often, with a wide variety of topics, from anything Civil War to Computer/Data Science to anything else that comes up.  

Primarily, I plan to enter into the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) again this year, using various languages to really test my skills. Obviously, R is my first and greatest, and Python to a lesser extent -- but over the last few months, I've been picking up ObservableJS. I primarily plan to use OJS for D3 and Plot visualizations, which of course necessitates learning the language in a greater sense as well.

Since Quarto has functionality to support R, Python, and OJS cells -- all interoperably, I might add -- who knows what will happen this year! I may flip around depending on the problem; for example, tasks dealing with navigating maps lends itself to a tibble structure, whereas set and lists are far easier to manage in Python and/or OJS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we go along, the topics will jump around, but that is the exciting part! I also do not plan on having any sort of schedule, so the posts will come just as sporadically as ever -- how fun!
