    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s get started with day 1!\nToday, after reading the problem, I feel like OJS will be easiest to handle all of these lists, so without further ado, let’s begin:\n\nPart 1\n\n{\n  const parsed = raw.split('\\n')\n      .map(d =&gt; {\n        return d.trimStart()\n                .replace(/\\s+/, '|')\n                .split('|')\n                .map(d =&gt; +d)\n      })\n\n  return parsed.map((d, i, me) =&gt; {\n      const diff = me.map(elem =&gt; elem[0]).sort()[i] - \n                   me.map(elem =&gt; elem[1]).sort()[i]\n      return diff &lt; 0 ? diff * -1 : diff\n    }).reduce((nxt, acc) =&gt; nxt + acc, 0)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst we need to parse out the input. I split on each newline, and used some regex to replace all the extra whitespace between the numbers with a delimeter, making splitting it into arrays quite simple.\nHowever, we need to map across the arrays and find the paired difference between the elements - after sorting - which I chose to do in one step using the this property of arrays when mapping.\nA simple conditional brings us home to our first star of the year!\nJust for fun, let’s do the same in R:\n\nraw %&gt;% \n  str_split(\"\\\\n\") %&gt;% \n  .[[1]] %&gt;% \n  map(str_squish) %&gt;% \n  map(~ str_split(.x, \" \")) %&gt;%\n  list_flatten() -&gt; parsed\n\nparsed %&gt;% \n  map(~ as.numeric(.x[[1]])) %&gt;% \n  list_c() %&gt;% \n  sort() %&gt;% \n  tibble(part_1 = .) %&gt;% \n  bind_cols({\n    parsed %&gt;% \n      map(~ as.numeric(.x[[2]])) %&gt;% \n      list_c() %&gt;% \n      sort() %&gt;% \n      tibble(part_2 = .)\n  }) -&gt; clean_data\n\nclean_data %&gt;% \n  mutate(diff = abs(part_2 - part_1)) %&gt;% \n  summarise(total = sum(diff)) %&gt;% \n  pull(total)\n\n[1] 2164381\n\n\nSimilar strategy as the OJS - parse the input and map across each set separately. However, this time, we’ll be taking advantage of the dataframe system in R, doing our calculations across columns, since the two lists are the same lengths.\n⭐\n\n\nPart 2\nSo for this part, we are tasked with counting the appearances of the first number list in the second, then multiplying across:\n\n{\n  const parsed = raw.split('\\n')\n      .map(d =&gt; {\n        return d.trimStart()\n                .replace(/\\s+/, '|')\n                .split('|')\n                .map(d =&gt; +d)\n      })\n  \n  const part_1 = parsed.map(d =&gt; d[0])\n  const part_2 = parsed.map(d =&gt; d[1])\n  \n  return part_1.reduce((acc, nxt) =&gt; {\n    return acc + nxt * ( part_2.filter(elem =&gt; elem === nxt).length )\n  }, 0)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot too bad of a solution, just copied/pasted the parsing from above, and actually split it into two arrays now instead of doing it all at once. That way, a basic accumulation across the first array (which we are treating as the ‘keys’ in this case), nets us our answer. Another way to do it would be create an object from list #2, with each number as a key and each count as a value, which would eliminate the repeating lookups.\nAnd again in R:\n\nparsed %&gt;% \n  map(~ as.numeric(.x[[1]])) %&gt;% \n  list_c() %&gt;% \n  sort() %&gt;% \n  tibble(part_1 = .) %&gt;% \n  left_join({\n    parsed %&gt;% \n      map(~ as.numeric(.x[[2]])) %&gt;% \n      list_c() %&gt;% \n      sort() %&gt;% \n      tibble(part_2 = .) %&gt;% \n      count(part_2)\n  }, join_by(part_1 == part_2)) %&gt;% \n\n  mutate(prod = part_1 * n) %&gt;% \n  summarise(total = sum(prod, na.rm = T)) %&gt;% \n  pull(total)\n\n[1] 20719933\n\n\nEasy enough – just need to join the groups together into a dataframe rather than binding columns straight across. This way, the summarised totals will dupe themselves as needed per number.\n⭐\n\nNot too hard for day 1…\n-CH"

    "title": "Baker’s Guard Zouaves",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What are they?\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves were companies of Irish Zouaves as a part of the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Specifically, they were companies I & K of the regiment, and functioned as flank companies and skirmishers for the regiment. However, this kind of functionality is quite standard for Zouaves of any nature during the civil war - so what makes these specific ones so special?\n\n\nHistory of the Zouave\nDuring the American Civil War, there was a definite craze for all things Zouave. Now, that can be hard to quantify, as there were many crazes of the time period - I mean half the country was trying to secede!\nHowever, this didn’t originate in the United States. In fact, the word “zouave” is French - it is a derivative of the original “Zouaouas”, the Berber tribe from which the first unit was to be levied for French service. The first unit of Zouaves was raised in Algeria in 1831 by the French, and they were outfitted with the traditional north-African clothing, including open jackets, baggy trousers, a fez-like hat, etc.\n\n\nZouaves in the US\nAs the Zouaves gained fame in the French army during their conquest of Africa, they became renowned as an elite fighting corps. Word quickly spread, through observers and military officials alike - soon everyone was talking about the fearsome Zouaves.\nThis included Elmer E. Ellsworth, an enterprising individual who obtained a Zouave training manual from his friend, who was a surgeon in the French North-African Zouave units. He then formed a touring company, which performed light infantry drills all over the nation, drumming up even more interest in these “foreign” soldiers.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, multiple units of Zouaves were formed, almost exclusively as militia units. Ellsworth’s own touring company became the 11th NY “Fire Zouaves”, on account of their red-trimmed uniforms.\nZouave uniforms were very similar to those of the French-Algerian troops: fez, baggy chasseur trousers, a shell jacket (which is open-fronted), jambieres (or gaiters), etc. These styles were often trimmed in red, both after the 11th NY and the original Zouaves - though they also had many swirls of embroidery as embellishments.\n\nFashion of the US during this time was also influenced by the famed Zouaves - tales of their exploits spread throughout the press, and many people wanted to dress like them as a result. Of course, men’s fashion was taken in with the designs, but more surprising was women’s fashion was as well. Many open-front Zouave-style jackets were worn as outerwear (as seen below), and the swirling, bold styles were also adopted into formal wear.\n\n\n\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves were raised as two different companies before being attached to the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry - I & K.\nCompany I was raised from two independent companies: “Gillen’s Independent Zouaves” and the “Philadelphia Zouave Cadets”.\nCompany K was raised from volunteers in Philadelphia by Cpt. William Davis, who was reported in the newspaper to be from the “gallant New York 69th”, another famed Irish regiment (from which the 69th Pennsylvania took it’s name).\nThe two regiments were named the “Baker’s Guard” Zouaves after Col. Edward D. Baker, who led the Philadelphia Brigade (of which the 69th Pennsylvania was assigned to).\nThese two companies, in the Zouave fashion, also had an extremely distinctive uniform. Similar to those of the 11th NY Fire Zouaves, and the 72nd and 95th Pennsylvania regiments of Zouaves, the Baker’s Guard Zouaves all wore the shortened shell jacket, vest, chasseur trousers, and jambieres; however, there were slight differences. As the rest of the units were trimmed in red, the Baker’s Guard uniforms were all trimmed in green, symbolic of their predominantly Irish heritage. Also, they opted to wear a kepi hat, also trimmed in green - rather than the traditional fez.\n\nWith such a different uniform, in the midst of war, one might assume they were only privately purchased - however, there are records of reissue:\n\nThis uniform was approved for reissue by the federal quartermasters in April of 1862, when Lieutenant Colonel George H. Crossman, Deputy Quartermaster at Philadelphia approved the manufacture of 160 uniforms “of the same pattern” which were known by the manufacturing firms of Rock & Wilson and Jacob Reed.\n\n\n\nBattle Record\nThe Baker’s Guard Zouaves, and to a greater extent the entire 69th Pennsylvania Infantry regiment, saw tons of action throughout the Civil war. Along with the Army of the Potomac, they fought in every major engagement from 1862 through the end of the war. Possibly most notably, the 69th Pennsylvania was pivotal in repelling Picket’s charge on day 3 of the battle of Gettysburg.\n\nOn a personal note, when I reenact the Civil War, I do so as a Baker’s Guard Zouave. My normal company portrays the post-Gettysburg version of Company A of the same regiment.\nIf you are interested in finding more about the Baker Guard Zouaves, they were Company K of the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 2nd Corps, Army of the Potomac.\n-CH"

    "title": "Cable News Coverage of the NY Trump Arraignment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Indictment & Arraignment\nDuring Fmr. Pres. Donald Trump’s initial bid for the White House in 2016, he allegedly paid “hush money” to Stormy Daniels so as to prevent the affair story from leaking to the press. In doing so, it could be considered a federal crime - violation of campaign finance rules, since the entire alleged effort was in support of his campaign.\nSpecifically, he faced 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Of course, this is huge news, and as such, all the major news networks were following the indictment and arrest of a former president. During the legal process, no cameras were allowed inside the courtroom, so most of the networks filled the air with discussion and analysis; however, each network’s coverage was not at all the same.\n\n\nThe Stratification of Cable News\nLegal proceedings can be very dry, and an overall extremely boring affair. Not to mention federal trials, which disallow cameras in the courtrooms - so there is quite literally nothing to see.\nAs alluded to above, to fill the air, news networks had to turn to analysts, experts and pundits. Of course, these folks all have different backgrounds, areas of interest - and perhaps most importantly, differing political slants. Shortly, we will see how the coverage taken by the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all covered the same events quite differently.\nHowever, the differences between cable news networks isn’t really news in and of itself - just about anyone can go on and on about the partisan news media and its many shortcomings. This is true, to some extent; however, there is an indisputable value of news coverage, regardless of the slant it may have.\nIf a news source is political, all that means is different varieties of coverage ought to be consumed to account for any shortcoming that one network or source may present. That said - enough of the philosophy of news networks and strategy - let’s dive into the similarities and differences in cable news network coverage of the NY Trump Arraignment.\n\n\nArraignment Coverage\nCertain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.\nIn my analysis, I aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. In the industry, this time period is often referred to as Sales Prime, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends late in order to capture the West Coast too).\nAs a reminder, for each 10-minute block (since that is the granularity of data provided by the GDELT Project), any time the word “Trump” was said, all the words in that block were included. This way, the words most commonly said around “Trump” will be considered. These adjacent words were then lemmatized (cleaned and grouped) and fuzzily combined across networks to find the 200 most common mentions.\nThe top words per network are plotted below:\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\nLet’s start at the top, and work our way around clockwise, beginning with:\n\nFox News\nThe words clustering towards the top of this section do not differ greatly from something you may see on any other night. This leads me to believe that the coverage during prime time was not nearly as specialized on Fox News as it was on the other two networks.\nAt the very top of the list are two anchor names (Jesse Waters and Sean Hannity), but also Joe Biden. Clearly, much of the coverage that involved Trump also involved references to the current president. It is a little hard to tell the context surrounding some of these uses; however, it is quite clear that comparisons were being made between the two.\nBased on other events happening around the same time, I would suggest that most of the coverage on Fox News revolved around the failings of the current president, as opposed to the alleged crimes of the former one.\n\n\nMSNBC\nMSNBC’s coverage was much more directed around the actual arraignment and indictment of Fmr. Pres. Trump; however, the most common word was “Wisconsin” - which was a totally different story.\nIt just so happened that the day following the arraignment of Trump was a state supreme court election in Wisconsin - which could have huge impacts down the line for the purple state. You can even see that the word “election” is far down and right towards the MSNBC corner, which makes total sense. That said, MSNBC’s coverage of the upcoming election must’ve been deeply tied to Trump, since the state was mentioned so often in tandem with the former president’s name.\nOutside of the Wisconsin saga, there were many oblique references to the arraignment, including “Manhattan” (site of the courthouse), “judge”, “trial”, etc. Most interestingly is the word “Republican”, which is drifting towards the side of MSNBC, indicating that their coverage tended to be slightly more partisan than that of CNN, which also split usage of the word.\n\n\nCNN\nSimilar to MSNBC, CNN’s coverage was largely focused on the arraignment itself. Most unique is the word “Tacopina”, which is the name of one of Trump’s lawyers. This speaks to the angle of coverage - where MSNBC might have covered the generalities of the arraignment, whereas CNN dove in the specifics of the legal team, arraignment process, etc.\nAdditionally, other top unique words include “CNN” and “team”, which indicates a definite focus on live, team coverage of the event. This lines up with what I already know of the network - it prides itself on breaking news and live coverage.\nOther than the team-focused words, CNN’s coverage largely matches up with that of MSNBC - which doesn’t come as all that much of a surprise. After all, both have largely democratic leaning audiences (though, on aggregate, MSNBC does tend to drift farther left).\n\nOverall, the coverage was really divided into two camps: arraignment-related (CNN, MSNBC) and non-arraignment-related (MSNBC, Fox News). MSNBC straddles the line - both focusing on the arraignment as well as the Wisconsin election.\nThe fewer words that are clustered around the center, the more stratified the coverage has become. Hopefully, as we move forward with the trial, the words that the cable news networks use to describe Trump and his legal proceedings can re-coalesce around the center of the triangle - indicating a return to normalized coverage.\n-CH"

No matter where I am, it’s always a great benchmark to compare against other restaurants.\nWhat is defining feature of the California burrito? Fries.\nAdding fries to a burrito elevates it to a whole other level; standard burritos just can’t compare. Add in the rest of your favorite toppings, and you have a wonderful burrito in your hands - but it all starts with the fries.\nIt must also be noted that a classic California burrito will have carne asada as the meat. Other versions do exist (for example, replacing the carne asada with chicken makes it an Arizona burrito), but none can compete with a perfectly executed California burrito.\n\n\nThe Rankings\nAll that to say, there are very important things that can separate one California burrito from another.\nWithout further ado, here are my rankings for best California burritos I have ever had:\n\nAlejandro’s (Carlsbad, CA) - CLOSED\nVallarta’s (Carlsbad, CA)\nThe Taco Stand (Encinitas, CA)\nElectric Burrito (New York City, NY)\nRoberto’s (Carlsbad, CA)\nCessy’s (Carlsbad, CA) - CLOSED\n\n\nIf you ever get a chance, seek out one of the above locations - or even make one yourself.

Obviously, R is my first and greatest, and Python to a lesser extent – but over the last few months, I’ve been picking up ObservableJS. I primarily plan to use OJS for D3 and Plot visualizations, which of course necessitates learning the language in a greater sense as well.\nSince Quarto has functionality to support R, Python, and OJS cells – all interoperably, I might add – who knows what will happen this year! I may flip around depending on the problem; for example, tasks dealing with navigating maps lends itself to a tibble structure, whereas set and lists are far easier to manage in Python and/or OJS.\n\nAs we go along, the topics will jump around, but that is the exciting part!
