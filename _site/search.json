    "section": "",
    "text": "The Runoffs\nAfter a deadlocked election night back in November that was much too close to call, the Georgia Senate election headed to a runoff. This election was held a few days ago, and finally settled once and for all who would be the newest Senator for Georgia.\nSenator Raphael Warnock won re-election to the U.S. Senate. Now, re-election comes with an asterisk, since his previous term was only two years (the result of a special election).\n\n\nCable News\nI know not everyone is as interested in the process, and even fewer are counting the data themselves. As such, we rely on the media to do this for us - including when to statistically decide when an election is over.\nHowever, these networks are not all the same, so they approach coverage a little differently - in some cases, a lot differently. As we’ll see shortly, the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all took very different courses of coverage.\nHowever, this isn’t really news in and of itself - ask anyone on the street, and they will tell you about the partisan nature of the news media. This is true, to some extent; however, there is a major push back towards the center for a lot of channels. In other words, there is a big move towards delivering straight news, and letting the viewer decide how to interpret the facts.\nThat said, let’s dive into the similarities and differences in network coverage of the Georgia Runoffs.\n\n\nRunoff Coverage\nCertain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.\nIn my analysis, I took aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. This time period is known as Sales Prime Time, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends so late in order to capture the West Coast too).\nFor each 10-minute block (since that is the granularity of data provided by the GDELT Project), any time the word “election” was said, all the words in that block were included. This way, the words most commonly said around “election” will be considered.\nThese adjacent words were then lemmatized (cleaned and grouped) and fuzzily combined across networks to find the 200 most common mentions.\nThe top words per network are plotted below:\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\nIn short - coverage was drastically different across the three networks.\nFirst, FOX did not specialize coverage the way CNN and MSNBC did - they kept their regularly scheduled programming and broke in with the news about the election every so often.\nOn the other hand, CNN and MSNBC both had a dedicated day and night of election coverage. This is why most of the election-related words are clustered towards the bottom of the triangle.\nTowards the FOX side, the words “border” and “sean” appear, which suggests their election coverage was fairly tied in to other news stories. In addition, the sparsity of the upper part of the triangle reinforces the idea that there wasn’t a whole lot of election-related coverage happening on that network.\nOn the MSNBC side, the words tend to be more general, such as “coalition”, “senator”, “democratic”, etc. This suggests that their coverage was largely focused on the big-picture story of the night: how the Georgia Runoff was going to impact the national balance of power moving forward. This larger-scale analysis served them well - they had the largest audience at the 10p hour when the election was called.1\nLastly, on CNN, the coverage was much more specific, with words such as “runoff”, “Herschel” and “Warnock” appearing frequently. This level of detail is most likely due in large part to their ‘Magic Wall’ formula, since they can quickly and easily drill down into specific parts of the election. “Donald” and “Trump” also appears quite heavily on the CNN side of the diagram, indicating that they were focused on the implication of another Trump-backed candidate losing their election - and what that means for the party.\n\nAll in all, the coverage was drastically different on all the networks. I am not sure if this is a by-product of the partisan age in which we live; nevertheless, it remains as important as ever to hear all sorts of viewpoints about the world. Only then will you be able to understand all that is going on around you.\n-CH\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n“Mediaite Cable News Ratings”↩︎"

    "title": "Cable News Coverage of the NY Trump Arraignment",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Indictment & Arraignment\nDuring Fmr. Pres. Donald Trump’s initial bid for the White House in 2016, he allegedly paid “hush money” to Stormy Daniels so as to prevent the affair story from leaking to the press. In doing so, it could be considered a federal crime - violation of campaign finance rules, since the entire alleged effort was in support of his campaign.\nSpecifically, he faced 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Of course, this is huge news, and as such, all the major news networks were following the indictment and arrest of a former president. During the legal process, no cameras were allowed inside the courtroom, so most of the networks filled the air with discussion and analysis; however, each network’s coverage was not at all the same.\n\n\nThe Stratification of Cable News\nLegal proceedings can be very dry, and an overall extremely boring affair. Not to mention federal trials, which disallow cameras in the courtrooms - so there is quite literally nothing to see.\nAs alluded to above, to fill the air, news networks had to turn to analysts, experts and pundits. Of course, these folks all have different backgrounds, areas of interest - and perhaps most importantly, differing political slants. Shortly, we will see how the coverage taken by the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all covered the same events quite differently.\nHowever, the differences between cable news networks isn’t really news in and of itself - just about anyone can go on and on about the partisan news media and its many shortcomings. This is true, to some extent; however, there is an indisputable value of news coverage, regardless of the slant it may have.\nIf a news source is political, all that means is different varieties of coverage ought to be consumed to account for any shortcoming that one network or source may present. That said - enough of the philosophy of news networks and strategy - let’s dive into the similarities and differences in cable news network coverage of the NY Trump Arraignment.\n\n\nArraignment Coverage\nCertain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.\nIn my analysis, I aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. In the industry, this time period is often referred to as Sales Prime, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends late in order to capture the West Coast too).\nAs a reminder, for each 10-minute block (since that is the granularity of data provided by the GDELT Project), any time the word “Trump” was said, all the words in that block were included. This way, the words most commonly said around “Trump” will be considered. These adjacent words were then lemmatized (cleaned and grouped) and fuzzily combined across networks to find the 200 most common mentions.\nThe top words per network are plotted below:\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean?\nLet’s start at the top, and work our way around clockwise, beginning with:\n\nFox News\nThe words clustering towards the top of this section do not differ greatly from something you may see on any other night. This leads me to believe that the coverage during prime time was not nearly as specialized on Fox News as it was on the other two networks.\nAt the very top of the list are two anchor names (Jesse Waters and Sean Hannity), but also Joe Biden. Clearly, much of the coverage that involved Trump also involved references to the current president. It is a little hard to tell the context surrounding some of these uses; however, it is quite clear that comparisons were being made between the two.\nBased on other events happening around the same time, I would suggest that most of the coverage on Fox News revolved around the failings of the current president, as opposed to the alleged crimes of the former one.\n\n\nMSNBC\nMSNBC’s coverage was much more directed around the actual arraignment and indictment of Fmr. Pres. Trump; however, the most common word was “Wisconsin” - which was a totally different story.\nIt just so happened that the day following the arraignment of Trump was a state supreme court election in Wisconsin - which could have huge impacts down the line for the purple state. You can even see that the word “election” is far down and right towards the MSNBC corner, which makes total sense. That said, MSNBC’s coverage of the upcoming election must’ve been deeply tied to Trump, since the state was mentioned so often in tandem with the former president’s name.\nOutside of the Wisconsin saga, there were many oblique references to the arraignment, including “Manhattan” (site of the courthouse), “judge”, “trial”, etc. Most interestingly is the word “Republican”, which is drifting towards the side of MSNBC, indicating that their coverage tended to be slightly more partisan than that of CNN, which also split usage of the word.\n\n\nCNN\nSimilar to MSNBC, CNN’s coverage was largely focused on the arraignment itself. Most unique is the word “Tacopina”, which is the name of one of Trump’s lawyers. This speaks to the angle of coverage - where MSNBC might have covered the generalities of the arraignment, whereas CNN dove in the specifics of the legal team, arraignment process, etc.\nAdditionally, other top unique words include “CNN” and “team”, which indicates a definite focus on live, team coverage of the event. This lines up with what I already know of the network - it prides itself on breaking news and live coverage.\nOther than the team-focused words, CNN’s coverage largely matches up with that of MSNBC - which doesn’t come as all that much of a surprise. After all, both have largely democratic leaning audiences (though, on aggregate, MSNBC does tend to drift farther left).\n\nOverall, the coverage was really divided into two camps: arraignment-related (CNN, MSNBC) and non-arraignment-related (MSNBC, Fox News). MSNBC straddles the line - both focusing on the arraignment as well as the Wisconsin election.\nThe fewer words that are clustered around the center, the more stratified the coverage has become. Hopefully, as we move forward with the trial, the words that the cable news networks use to describe Trump and his legal proceedings can re-coalesce around the center of the triangle - indicating a return to normalized coverage.\n-CH"

    "title": "Baker’s Guard Zouaves",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What are they?\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves were companies of Irish Zouaves as a part of the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Specifically, they were companies I & K of the regiment, and functioned as flank companies and skirmishers for the regiment. However, this kind of functionality is quite standard for Zouaves of any nature during the civil war - so what makes these specific ones so special?\n\n\nHistory of the Zouave\nDuring the American Civil War, there was a definite craze for all things Zouave. Now, that can be hard to quantify, as there were many crazes of the time period - I mean half the country was trying to secede!\nHowever, this didn’t originate in the United States. In fact, the word “zouave” is French - it is a derivative of the original “Zouaouas”, the Berber tribe from which the first unit was to be levied for French service. The first unit of Zouaves was raised in Algeria in 1831 by the French, and they were outfitted with the traditional north-African clothing, including open jackets, baggy trousers, a fez-like hat, etc.\n\n\nZouaves in the US\nAs the Zouaves gained fame in the French army during their conquest of Africa, they became renowned as an elite fighting corps. Word quickly spread, through observers and military officials alike - soon everyone was talking about the fearsome Zouaves.\nThis included Elmer E. Ellsworth, an enterprising individual who obtained a Zouave training manual from his friend, who was a surgeon in the French North-African Zouave units. He then formed a touring company, which performed light infantry drills all over the nation, drumming up even more interest in these “foreign” soldiers.\n\nWhen the Civil War broke out, multiple units of Zouaves were formed, almost exclusively as militia units. Ellsworth’s own touring company became the 11th NY “Fire Zouaves”, on account of their red-trimmed uniforms.\nZouave uniforms were very similar to those of the French-Algerian troops: fez, baggy chasseur trousers, a shell jacket (which is open-fronted), jambieres (or gaiters), etc. These styles were often trimmed in red, both after the 11th NY and the original Zouaves - though they also had many swirls of embroidery as embellishments.\n\nFashion of the US during this time was also influenced by the famed Zouaves - tales of their exploits spread throughout the press, and many people wanted to dress like them as a result. Of course, men’s fashion was taken in with the designs, but more surprising was women’s fashion was as well. Many open-front Zouave-style jackets were worn as outerwear (as seen below), and the swirling, bold styles were also adopted into formal wear.\n\n\n\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves\nBaker’s Guard Zouaves were raised as two different companies before being attached to the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry - I & K.\nCompany I was raised from two independent companies: “Gillen’s Independent Zouaves” and the “Philadelphia Zouave Cadets”.\nCompany K was raised from volunteers in Philadelphia by Cpt. William Davis, who was reported in the newspaper to be from the “gallant New York 69th”, another famed Irish regiment (from which the 69th Pennsylvania took it’s name).\nThe two regiments were named the “Baker’s Guard” Zouaves after Col. Edward D. Baker, who led the Philadelphia Brigade (of which the 69th Pennsylvania was assigned to).\nThese two companies, in the Zouave fashion, also had an extremely distinctive uniform. Similar to those of the 11th NY Fire Zouaves, and the 72nd and 95th Pennsylvania regiments of Zouaves, the Baker’s Guard Zouaves all wore the shortened shell jacket, vest, chasseur trousers, and jambieres; however, there were slight differences. As the rest of the units were trimmed in red, the Baker’s Guard uniforms were all trimmed in green, symbolic of their predominantly Irish heritage. Also, they opted to wear a kepi hat, also trimmed in green - rather than the traditional fez.\n\nWith such a different uniform, in the midst of war, one might assume they were only privately purchased - however, there are records of reissue:\n\nThis uniform was approved for reissue by the federal quartermasters in April of 1862, when Lieutenant Colonel George H. Crossman, Deputy Quartermaster at Philadelphia approved the manufacture of 160 uniforms “of the same pattern” which were known by the manufacturing firms of Rock & Wilson and Jacob Reed.\n\n\n\nBattle Record\nThe Baker’s Guard Zouaves, and to a greater extent the entire 69th Pennsylvania Infantry regiment, saw tons of action throughout the Civil war. Along with the Army of the Potomac, they fought in every major engagement from 1862 through the end of the war. Possibly most notably, the 69th Pennsylvania was pivotal in repelling Picket’s charge on day 3 of the battle of Gettysburg.\n\nOn a personal note, when I reenact the Civil War, I do so as a Baker’s Guard Zouave. My normal company portrays the post-Gettysburg version of Company A of the same regiment.\nIf you are interested in finding more about the Baker Guard Zouaves, they were Company K of the 69th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, 2nd Corps, Army of the Potomac.\n-CH"

    "text": "What Are They?\nCalifornia burritos are very near and dear to me - if I go to a Mexican restaurant, I will undoubtedly get their version of a California burrito. No matter where I am, it’s always a great benchmark to compare against other restaurants.\nWhat is defining feature of the California burrito? Fries.\nAdding fries to a burrito elevates it to a whole other level; standard burritos just can’t compare. Add in the rest of your favorite toppings, and you have a wonderful burrito in your hands - but it all starts with the fries.\nIt must also be noted that a classic California burrito will have carne asada as the meat. Other versions do exist (for example, replacing the carne asada with chicken makes it an Arizona burrito), but none can compete with a perfectly executed California burrito.\n\n\nThe Rankings\nAll that to say, there are very important things that can separate one California burrito from another.\nWithout further ado, here are my rankings for best California burritos I have ever had:\n\nAlejandro’s (Carlsbad, CA) - CLOSED\nVallarta’s (Carlsbad, CA)\nThe Taco Stand (Encinitas, CA)\nElectric Burrito (New York City, NY)\nRoberto’s (Carlsbad, CA)\nCessy’s (Carlsbad, CA) - CLOSED\n\n\nIf you ever get a chance, seek out one of the above locations - or even make one yourself.

    "title": "John Hardy vs. John Henry",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ballads\nIn folk music, these two fabled characters are often intertwined. Both ballads, they tell the stories of their respective heroes - one, a railroad worker hanged for murder; the other, a steel-driving man who died working on the railroad.\nInitially, it must be said, that both men do share two initial similarities: they both worked on or for a railroad and their names are almost identical. Additionally, they both lived and died around the same period, in the same part of the country - coincidence?\n\n\nMeet John Hardy\nJohn Hardy, on his own, is an interesting character. Now, right off the bat, there are two main John Hardys to know about:\n\nThe first, was employed as a steel-driller in southern West Virginia in 1872, killed a man after a gambling incident near the Virginia state line, and was hung right around the same area\n\n\nThe second, was working as a coal miner in southern West Virginia in 1893, killed a man after a game of craps (over a total of 75 cents - $25 in 2022), and was executed by hanging near the Virginia state line\n\nAs you can see there are many striking likenesses between the two versions of John Hardy. Indeed, they are remarkably similar, even more so when you consider that some accounts describe them both as African American men over six feet tall.\nGiven everything above, the biggest difference between the two Hardys is the timeline. The second John Hardy would have to be twenty-ish years older than the former John Hardy. This discrepancy can be fairly easily accounted for when considering the interviews Cox conducted for his essay. 1\nYou may be wondering - if he is supposed to have died in 1872, how can the same John Hardy die in 1894? Well, this is where the stories become extremely tangled. It was suggested that one of these two John Hardys was actually a white man - however, as seen in the excerpt below, it wouldn’t make much sense:\n\n“Probability indicates that these two stories are about the same man. For a white man contemporary with the steel-driller to possess the same name and attributes as he, to operate in the early part of his career in the same region, to drift later to the same locality, to commit the same crime, and to pay the same penalty, is not believable.” 2\n\nAs can plainly be seen, these John Hardys are more likely than not to be the same person - they share not only a name, but also a common description, crime, and penalty (all in the same locale around roughly the same time).\n\n\nEnter John Henry\nJohn Henry is known far and wide to be a steel-drilling man who died via over-exertion after challenging a steam-drill. 3 However, that does overlap with some accounts of John Hardy - specifically, the 1872 John Hardy from above.\nThis John Hardy was also reported to have died in a steel-drilling challenge. While working for the Langhorn Company, a steam drill was brought in to be used to help build the C. & O. railroad. Hardy was known to be the best steel-driller around, so he challenged the steam driller to see who could drill more steel. As the story goes in many of the ballads, as the challenge was very close - though John Hardy eventually lost, laying down to die next to his hammer.\nThese two stories are remarkably similar - not only were they both steel-drillers, but both challenged a steam-drill, and both worked in the same locale on the same railroad.\nI know, you are probably thinking: “But wait! You said John Hardy died from fighting over gambling, not from working on the railroad!”\nCorrect, and there are a few reasons why that is. First, it may just be a case of oral transmission (akin to a game of telephone, if you will):\n\n“The change of name to John Henry, and the victory into a defeat, is not significant, and is easily accounted for by oral transmission. The same process of reasoning as applied heretofore identifies John Henry with John Hardy, who could not have died at the end of a drilling-contest. Most likely the ballad celebrating the prowess of John Hardy gradually, in its earlier making, enhanced that prowess, and, by the natural tendency to a tragic ending, finally sang of his defeat and death.” 4\n\nSecondly, several accounts of primary sources back up that they could be the same person:\n\n‘Upon inquiry by Cox, ex-Gov. McCorkle writes, “You are mistaken when you say John Hardy died from the drilling-contest.”’ 5\n\nLastly, the drilling contest may not have even happened! This telling of a man whose worth and identity are measured only by his strength, which is then challenged by the advent of steam power, is a story that has endured for over a century. 6 It’s tragic, it’s compelling - in short, it’s everything that is needed for a ballad.\nWhen Cox sent a letter to the Ingersoll-Rand Company (the authority on drills), he received the following reply:\n\n“…it is rather improbable that steam rock-drills were used in the building of the C&O Railroad…” 7\n\n\n\nSo… Who is Who?\nIn short, we do not really know for certain. It is popularly believed that they are two separate people - John Henry the steel-driller and John Hardy the murderous gambler. However, there is much confusion that still exists around this, especially since there are many different versions of the ballads. The early versions of the ballads themselves mix the lyrics and stanzas around, so it really is hard to be sure.\nAs for me, I like to think that they are the same person.\n-CH\n\nClick here to listen to different versions of the ballads!\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\n“John Hardy” (1919) by John Harrington Cox.↩︎\n“John Hardy” (1919) by John Harrington Cox.↩︎\n“John Henry” (Library of Congress)↩︎\n“John Hardy” (1919) by John Harrington Cox.↩︎\n“John Hardy” (1919) by John Harrington Cox.↩︎\n“John Henry” (Library of Congress)↩︎\n“John Hardy” (1919) by John Harrington Cox.↩︎"
