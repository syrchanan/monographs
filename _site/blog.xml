  <title>Cable News Coverage of the Georgia Runoffs</title>
  <link>https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-ga-runoff/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-runoffs">The Runoffs</h3>
<p>After a deadlocked election night back in November that was much too close to call, the Georgia Senate election headed to a runoff. This election was held a few days ago, and finally settled once and for all who would be the newest Senator for Georgia.</p>
<p>Senator Raphael Warnock won re-election to the U.S. Senate. Now, re-election comes with an asterisk, since his previous term was only two years (the result of a special election).</p>
</section>
<section id="cable-news" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cable-news">Cable News</h3>
<p>I know not everyone is as interested in the process, and even fewer are counting the data themselves. As such, we rely on the media to do this for us - including when to statistically decide when an election is over.</p>
<p>However, these networks are not all the same, so they approach coverage a little differently - in some cases, a lot differently. As we’ll see shortly, the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all took very different courses of coverage.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t really news in and of itself - ask anyone on the street, and they will tell you about the partisan nature of the news media. This is true, to some extent; however, there is a major push back towards the center for a lot of channels. In other words, there is a big move towards delivering straight news, and letting the viewer decide how to interpret the facts.</p>
<p>That said, let’s dive into the similarities and differences in network coverage of the Georgia Runoffs.</p>
</section>
<section id="runoff-coverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="runoff-coverage">Runoff Coverage</h3>
<p>Certain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.</p>
<p>In my analysis, I took aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. This time period is known as Sales Prime Time, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends so late in order to capture the West Coast too).</p>
<p>For each 10-minute block (since that is the granularity of data provided by the GDELT Project), any time the word “election” was said, all the words in that block were included. This way, the words most commonly said around “election” will be considered.</p>
<p>These adjacent words were then lemmatized (cleaned and grouped) and fuzzily combined across networks to find the 200 most common mentions.</p>
<p>The top words per network are plotted below:</p>

</section>
<section id="so-what-does-this-mean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h3>
<p>In short - coverage was drastically different across the three networks.</p>
<p>First, FOX did not specialize coverage the way CNN and MSNBC did - they kept their regularly scheduled programming and broke in with the news about the election every so often.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CNN and MSNBC both had a dedicated day and night of election coverage. This is why most of the election-related words are clustered towards the bottom of the triangle.</p>
<p>Towards the FOX side, the words “border” and “sean” appear, which suggests their election coverage was fairly tied in to other news stories. In addition, the sparsity of the upper part of the triangle reinforces the idea that there wasn’t a whole lot of election-related coverage happening on that network.</p>
<p>On the MSNBC side, the words tend to be more general, such as “coalition”, “senator”, “democratic”, etc. This suggests that their coverage was largely focused on the big-picture story of the night: how the Georgia Runoff was going to impact the national balance of power moving forward. This larger-scale analysis served them well - they had the largest audience at the 10p hour when the election was called.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Lastly, on CNN, the coverage was much more specific, with words such as “runoff”, “Herschel” and “Warnock” appearing frequently. This level of detail is most likely due in large part to their ‘Magic Wall’ formula, since they can quickly and easily drill down into specific parts of the election. “Donald” and “Trump” also appears quite heavily on the CNN side of the diagram, indicating that they were focused on the implication of another Trump-backed candidate losing their election - and what that means for the party.</p>
<hr>
<p>All in all, the coverage was drastically different on all the networks. I am not sure if this is a by-product of the partisan age in which we live; nevertheless, it remains as important as ever to hear all sorts of viewpoints about the world. Only then will you be able to understand all that is going on around you.</p>

  <title>2022 World Cup Picks</title>
  <link>https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-world-cup/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="background" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h3>
<p>First and foremost, I have to make it clear - I know very little of the international soccer scene.</p>
<p>That said, I have constructed a bracket of my 2022 World Cup picks.</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are my picks:</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="group-stage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-stage">Group Stage</h3>
<p><img src="https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-world-cup/group_stage.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There isn’t much rhyme or reason as to my picks here - they are purely based on which teams sound good. I’ll discuss a few of the picks, but for the most part, just know they are fairly random in nature.</p>
<hr>
<section id="group-a" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-a">Group A</h4>
<p>I like to think tall folks are good at soccer, thus the Netherlands in the 1 slot.</p>
<p>I also gave the benefit of the doubt to the hosts, which is why they are not last in their group.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="group-b" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-b">Group B</h4>
<p>IT’S COMING (almost all the way) HOME!</p>
<p>Followed closely by the US because I hear they might be somewhat decent this year - more on that later.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="groups-e-and-g" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="groups-e-and-g">Groups E and G</h4>
<p>I like the idea of a Brazil v. Germany rematch in the elimination rounds, so I wanted them both to win out to be on the same side of the bracket.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="elimination-rounds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elimination-rounds">Elimination Rounds</h3>
<section id="top-half-of-the-bracket" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="top-half-of-the-bracket">Top Half of the Bracket</h4>
<p><img src="https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-world-cup/top_half.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>I have heard that the US is looking the best it has ever been in recent years - which I why I have them picked in a gutsy win over the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In the other match, Argentina seems like they are perennially at least in the discussion, so I gave them the nod.</p>
<p>Between the US and Argentina - I unfortunately think the luck will run out for the United States.</p>
<p>In the other two games, as I mentioned before, I would love to see a rematch between Germany and Brazil, so they both make it through to play against one another. In that grudge match - I like Brazil this time.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="bottom-half-of-the-bracket" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bottom-half-of-the-bracket">Bottom Half of the Bracket</h4>
<p><img src="https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-world-cup/bottom_half.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>In the other side, I still would like England to advance, as well as France. They both are good Euro teams (I think), and ages ago they were rivals (I’m talking like Joan of Arc time).</p>
<p>Croatia I think might be challenged by Spain, but in the end, the Croatians will advance through the round to meet Portugal (who makes it past CMR in their match up).</p>
<p>Croatia ought to carry the win in the next round - at least, I would like to see them do so, for no other reason than they are better in water polo than Spain.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="semis-and-finals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="semis-and-finals">Semis and Finals</h3>
<p><img src="https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-world-cup/last_two.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>In the first semi-final, it’s a match up between two classic teams: Argentina and Brazil. I think that if Brazil makes it to this round through Germany, they will be able to carry the momentum through and take down Argentina.</p>
<p>On the other side - I still have a good feeling about Croatia. As much as I would like to see England take it all the way, I think that they won’t be able to stop the Croatian onslaught.</p>
<p>And finally… in the finals…</p>
<p>Croatia! I mean what is not to like?! Their fans even wear water polo caps at their matches!</p>
<hr>
<p>There you have it! My picks for the 2022 World Cup. We’ll have to wait and see how things land.</p>
<p>-CH</p>

  <title>John Hardy vs. John Henry</title>

<section id="the-ballads" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ballads">The Ballads</h3>
<p>In folk music, these two fabled characters are often intertwined. Both ballads, they tell the stories of their respective heroes - one, a railroad worker hanged for murder; the other, a steel-driving man who died working on the railroad.</p>
<p>Initially, it must be said, that both men do share two initial similarities: they both worked on or for a railroad and their names are almost identical. Additionally, they both lived and died around the same period, in the same part of the country - coincidence?</p>
</section>
<section id="meet-john-hardy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meet-john-hardy">Meet John Hardy</h3>
<p>John Hardy, on his own, is an interesting character. Now, right off the bat, there are two main John Hardys to know about:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first, was employed as a steel-driller in southern West Virginia in 1872, killed a man after a gambling incident near the Virginia state line, and was hung right around the same area</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second, was working as a coal miner in southern West Virginia in 1893, killed a man after a game of craps (over a total of 75 cents - $25 in 2022), and was executed by hanging near the Virginia state line</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see there are many striking likenesses between the two versions of John Hardy. Indeed, they are remarkably similar, even more so when you consider that some accounts describe them both as African American men over six feet tall.</p>
<p>Given everything above, the biggest difference between the two Hardys is the timeline. The second John Hardy would have to be twenty-ish years older than the former John Hardy. This discrepancy can be fairly easily accounted for when considering the interviews Cox conducted for his essay. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>You may be wondering - if he is supposed to have died in 1872, how can the same John Hardy die in 1894? Well, this is where the stories become extremely tangled. It was suggested that one of these two John Hardys was actually a white man - however, as seen in the excerpt below, it wouldn’t make much sense:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Probability indicates that these two stories are about the same man. For a white man contemporary with the steel-driller to possess the same name and attributes as he, to operate in the early part of his career in the same region, to drift later to the same locality, to commit the same crime, and to pay the same penalty, is not believable.” <sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can plainly be seen, these John Hardys are more likely than not to be the same person - they share not only a name, but also a common description, crime, and penalty (all in the same locale around roughly the same time).</p>
</section>
<section id="enter-john-henry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enter-john-henry">Enter John Henry</h3>
<p>John Henry is known far and wide to be a steel-drilling man who died via over-exertion after challenging a steam-drill. <sup>3</sup> However, that does overlap with some accounts of John Hardy - specifically, the 1872 John Hardy from above.</p>
<p>This John Hardy was also reported to have died in a steel-drilling challenge. While working for the Langhorn Company, a steam drill was brought in to be used to help build the C. &amp; O. railroad. Hardy was known to be the best steel-driller around, so he challenged the steam driller to see who could drill more steel. As the story goes in many of the ballads, as the challenge was very close - though John Hardy eventually lost, laying down to die next to his hammer.</p>
<p>These two stories are remarkably similar - not only were they both steel-drillers, but both challenged a steam-drill, and both worked in the same locale on the same railroad.</p>
<p>I know, you are probably thinking: “But wait! You said John Hardy died from fighting over gambling, not from working on the railroad!”</p>
<p>Correct, and there are a few reasons why that is. First, it may just be a case of oral transmission (akin to a game of telephone, if you will):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The change of name to John Henry, and the victory into a defeat, is not significant, and is easily accounted for by oral transmission. The same process of reasoning as applied heretofore identifies John Henry with John Hardy, who could not have died at the end of a drilling-contest. Most likely the ballad celebrating the prowess of John Hardy gradually, in its earlier making, enhanced that prowess, and, by the natural tendency to a tragic ending, finally sang of his defeat and death.” <sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, several accounts of primary sources back up that they could be the same person:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘Upon inquiry by Cox, ex-Gov.&nbsp;McCorkle writes, “You are mistaken when you say John Hardy died from the drilling-contest.”’ <sup>5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the drilling contest may not have even happened! This telling of a man whose worth and identity are measured only by his strength, which is then challenged by the advent of steam power, is a story that has endured for over a century. <sup>6</sup> It’s tragic, it’s compelling - in short, it’s everything that is needed for a ballad.</p>
<p>When Cox sent a letter to the Ingersoll-Rand Company (the authority on drills), he received the following reply:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…it is rather improbable that steam rock-drills were used in the building of the C&amp;O Railroad…” <sup>7</sup></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="so-who-is-who" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-who-is-who">So… Who is Who?</h3>
<p>In short, we do not really know for certain. It is popularly believed that they are two separate people - John Henry the steel-driller and John Hardy the murderous gambler. However, there is much confusion that still exists around this, especially since there are many different versions of the ballads. The early versions of the ballads themselves mix the lyrics and stanzas around, so it really is hard to be sure.</p>
<p>As for me, I like to think that they are the same person.</p>
