<section id="the-indictment-arraignment" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-indictment-arraignment">The Indictment &amp; Arraignment</h3>
<p>During Fmr. Pres.&nbsp;Donald Trump’s initial bid for the White House in 2016, he allegedly paid “hush money” to Stormy Daniels so as to prevent the affair story from leaking to the press. In doing so, it could be considered a federal crime - violation of campaign finance rules, since the entire alleged effort was in support of his campaign.</p>
<p>Specifically, he faced 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. Of course, this is huge news, and as such, all the major news networks were following the indictment and arrest of a former president. During the legal process, no cameras were allowed inside the courtroom, so most of the networks filled the air with discussion and analysis; however, each network’s coverage was not at all the same.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-stratification-of-cable-news" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-stratification-of-cable-news">The Stratification of Cable News</h3>
<p>Legal proceedings can be very dry, and an overall extremely boring affair. Not to mention federal trials, which disallow cameras in the courtrooms - so there is quite literally nothing to see.</p>
<p>As alluded to above, to fill the air, news networks had to turn to analysts, experts and pundits. Of course, these folks all have different backgrounds, areas of interest - and perhaps most importantly, differing political slants. Shortly, we will see how the coverage taken by the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all covered the same events quite differently.</p>
<p>However, the differences between cable news networks isn’t really news in and of itself - just about anyone can go on and on about the partisan news media and its many shortcomings. This is true, to some extent; however, there is an indisputable value of news coverage, regardless of the slant it may have.</p>
<p>If a news source is political, all that means is different varieties of coverage ought to be consumed to account for any shortcoming that one network or source may present. That said - enough of the philosophy of news networks and strategy - let’s dive into the similarities and differences in cable news network coverage of the NY Trump Arraignment.</p>
</section>
<section id="arraignment-coverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arraignment-coverage">Arraignment Coverage</h3>
<p>Certain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.</p>
<p>In my analysis, I aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. In the industry, this time period is often referred to as Sales Prime, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends late in order to capture the West Coast too).</p>
<p>As a reminder, for each 10-minute block (since that is the granularity of data provided by the GDELT Project), any time the word “Trump” was said, all the words in that block were included. This way, the words most commonly said around “Trump” will be considered. These adjacent words were then lemmatized (cleaned and grouped) and fuzzily combined across networks to find the 200 most common mentions.</p>
<p>The top words per network are plotted below:</p>

</section>
<section id="so-what-does-this-mean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h3>
<p>Let’s start at the top, and work our way around clockwise, beginning with:</p>
<section id="fox-news" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fox-news">Fox News</h4>
<p>The words clustering towards the top of this section do not differ greatly from something you may see on any other night. This leads me to believe that the coverage during prime time was not nearly as specialized on Fox News as it was on the other two networks.</p>
<p>At the very top of the list are two anchor names (<strong>Jesse</strong> Waters and <strong>Sean</strong> Hannity), but also Joe <strong>Biden</strong>. Clearly, much of the coverage that involved Trump also involved references to the current president. It is a little hard to tell the context surrounding some of these uses; however, it is quite clear that comparisons were being made between the two.</p>
<p>Based on other events happening around the same time, I would suggest that most of the coverage on Fox News revolved around the failings of the current president, as opposed to the alleged crimes of the former one.</p>
</section>
<section id="msnbc" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="msnbc">MSNBC</h4>
<p>MSNBC’s coverage was much more directed around the actual arraignment and indictment of Fmr. Pres.&nbsp;Trump; however, the most common word was “Wisconsin” - which was a totally different story.</p>
<p>It just so happened that the day following the arraignment of Trump was a state supreme court election in Wisconsin - which could have huge impacts down the line for the purple state. You can even see that the word “election” is far down and right towards the MSNBC corner, which makes total sense. That said, MSNBC’s coverage of the upcoming election must’ve been deeply tied to Trump, since the state was mentioned so often in tandem with the former president’s name.</p>
<p>Outside of the Wisconsin saga, there were many oblique references to the arraignment, including “Manhattan” (site of the courthouse), “judge”, “trial”, etc. Most interestingly is the word “Republican”, which is drifting towards the side of MSNBC, indicating that their coverage tended to be slightly more partisan than that of CNN, which also split usage of the word.</p>
</section>
<section id="cnn" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cnn">CNN</h4>
<p>Similar to MSNBC, CNN’s coverage was largely focused on the arraignment itself. Most unique is the word “Tacopina”, which is the name of one of Trump’s lawyers. This speaks to the angle of coverage - where MSNBC might have covered the generalities of the arraignment, whereas CNN dove in the specifics of the legal team, arraignment process, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, other top unique words include “CNN” and “team”, which indicates a definite focus on live, team coverage of the event. This lines up with what I already know of the network - it prides itself on breaking news and live coverage.</p>
<p>Other than the team-focused words, CNN’s coverage largely matches up with that of MSNBC - which doesn’t come as all that much of a surprise. After all, both have largely democratic leaning audiences (though, on aggregate, MSNBC does tend to drift farther left).</p>
<hr>
<p>Overall, the coverage was really divided into two camps: arraignment-related (CNN, MSNBC) and non-arraignment-related (MSNBC, Fox News). MSNBC straddles the line - both focusing on the arraignment as well as the Wisconsin election.</p>
<p>The fewer words that are clustered around the center, the more stratified the coverage has become. Hopefully, as we move forward with the trial, the words that the cable news networks use to describe Trump and his legal proceedings can re-coalesce around the center of the triangle - indicating a return to normalized coverage.</p>

  <title>Cable News Coverage of the Georgia Runoffs</title>
  <link>https://quartopub.com/sites/syrchanan/monographs/posts/2022-ga-runoff/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<section id="the-runoffs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-runoffs">The Runoffs</h3>
<p>After a deadlocked election night back in November that was much too close to call, the Georgia Senate election headed to a runoff. This election was held a few days ago, and finally settled once and for all who would be the newest Senator for Georgia.</p>
<p>Senator Raphael Warnock won re-election to the U.S. Senate. Now, re-election comes with an asterisk, since his previous term was only two years (the result of a special election).</p>
</section>
<section id="cable-news" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cable-news">Cable News</h3>
<p>I know not everyone is as interested in the process, and even fewer are counting the data themselves. As such, we rely on the media to do this for us - including when to statistically decide when an election is over.</p>
<p>However, these networks are not all the same, so they approach coverage a little differently - in some cases, a lot differently. As we’ll see shortly, the big three cable networks (CNN, MSNBC and FOX News) all took very different courses of coverage.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t really news in and of itself - ask anyone on the street, and they will tell you about the partisan nature of the news media. This is true, to some extent; however, there is a major push back towards the center for a lot of channels. In other words, there is a big move towards delivering straight news, and letting the viewer decide how to interpret the facts.</p>
<p>That said, let’s dive into the similarities and differences in network coverage of the Georgia Runoffs.</p>
</section>
<section id="runoff-coverage" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="runoff-coverage">Runoff Coverage</h3>
<p>Certain words that are used can be very revealing about a network’s coverage - especially if they differ greatly from the other networks.</p>
<p>In my analysis, I took aggregated all of the closed captions from CNN, FOX and MSNBC between the hours of 7 p.m. and 3 a.m. ET. This time period is known as Sales Prime Time, which is the block of coverage which sees the largest audiences across the board (it extends so late in order to capture the West Coast too).</p>

<p>The top words per network are plotted below:</p>

</section>
<section id="so-what-does-this-mean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-does-this-mean">So what does this mean?</h3>
<p>In short - coverage was drastically different across the three networks.</p>
<p>First, FOX did not specialize coverage the way CNN and MSNBC did - they kept their regularly scheduled programming and broke in with the news about the election every so often.</p>
<p>On the other hand, CNN and MSNBC both had a dedicated day and night of election coverage. This is why most of the election-related words are clustered towards the bottom of the triangle.</p>
<p>Towards the FOX side, the words “border” and “sean” appear, which suggests their election coverage was fairly tied in to other news stories. In addition, the sparsity of the upper part of the triangle reinforces the idea that there wasn’t a whole lot of election-related coverage happening on that network.</p>
<p>On the MSNBC side, the words tend to be more general, such as “coalition”, “senator”, “democratic”, etc. This suggests that their coverage was largely focused on the big-picture story of the night: how the Georgia Runoff was going to impact the national balance of power moving forward. This larger-scale analysis served them well - they had the largest audience at the 10p hour when the election was called.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Lastly, on CNN, the coverage was much more specific, with words such as “runoff”, “Herschel” and “Warnock” appearing frequently. This level of detail is most likely due in large part to their ‘Magic Wall’ formula, since they can quickly and easily drill down into specific parts of the election. “Donald” and “Trump” also appears quite heavily on the CNN side of the diagram, indicating that they were focused on the implication of another Trump-backed candidate losing their election - and what that means for the party.</p>
<hr>
<p>All in all, the coverage was drastically different on all the networks. I am not sure if this is a by-product of the partisan age in which we live; nevertheless, it remains as important as ever to hear all sorts of viewpoints about the world. Only then will you be able to understand all that is going on around you.</p>

  <title>John Hardy vs. John Henry</title>

<section id="the-ballads" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-ballads">The Ballads</h3>
<p>In folk music, these two fabled characters are often intertwined. Both ballads, they tell the stories of their respective heroes - one, a railroad worker hanged for murder; the other, a steel-driving man who died working on the railroad.</p>
<p>Initially, it must be said, that both men do share two initial similarities: they both worked on or for a railroad and their names are almost identical. Additionally, they both lived and died around the same period, in the same part of the country - coincidence?</p>
</section>
<section id="meet-john-hardy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="meet-john-hardy">Meet John Hardy</h3>
<p>John Hardy, on his own, is an interesting character. Now, right off the bat, there are two main John Hardys to know about:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The first, was employed as a steel-driller in southern West Virginia in 1872, killed a man after a gambling incident near the Virginia state line, and was hung right around the same area</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The second, was working as a coal miner in southern West Virginia in 1893, killed a man after a game of craps (over a total of 75 cents - $25 in 2022), and was executed by hanging near the Virginia state line</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see there are many striking likenesses between the two versions of John Hardy. Indeed, they are remarkably similar, even more so when you consider that some accounts describe them both as African American men over six feet tall.</p>
<p>Given everything above, the biggest difference between the two Hardys is the timeline. The second John Hardy would have to be twenty-ish years older than the former John Hardy. This discrepancy can be fairly easily accounted for when considering the interviews Cox conducted for his essay. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>You may be wondering - if he is supposed to have died in 1872, how can the same John Hardy die in 1894? Well, this is where the stories become extremely tangled. It was suggested that one of these two John Hardys was actually a white man - however, as seen in the excerpt below, it wouldn’t make much sense:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Probability indicates that these two stories are about the same man. For a white man contemporary with the steel-driller to possess the same name and attributes as he, to operate in the early part of his career in the same region, to drift later to the same locality, to commit the same crime, and to pay the same penalty, is not believable.” <sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As can plainly be seen, these John Hardys are more likely than not to be the same person - they share not only a name, but also a common description, crime, and penalty (all in the same locale around roughly the same time).</p>
</section>
<section id="enter-john-henry" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enter-john-henry">Enter John Henry</h3>
<p>John Henry is known far and wide to be a steel-drilling man who died via over-exertion after challenging a steam-drill. <sup>3</sup> However, that does overlap with some accounts of John Hardy - specifically, the 1872 John Hardy from above.</p>
<p>This John Hardy was also reported to have died in a steel-drilling challenge. While working for the Langhorn Company, a steam drill was brought in to be used to help build the C. &amp; O. railroad. Hardy was known to be the best steel-driller around, so he challenged the steam driller to see who could drill more steel. As the story goes in many of the ballads, as the challenge was very close - though John Hardy eventually lost, laying down to die next to his hammer.</p>
<p>These two stories are remarkably similar - not only were they both steel-drillers, but both challenged a steam-drill, and both worked in the same locale on the same railroad.</p>
<p>I know, you are probably thinking: “But wait! You said John Hardy died from fighting over gambling, not from working on the railroad!”</p>
<p>Correct, and there are a few reasons why that is. First, it may just be a case of oral transmission (akin to a game of telephone, if you will):</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The change of name to John Henry, and the victory into a defeat, is not significant, and is easily accounted for by oral transmission. The same process of reasoning as applied heretofore identifies John Henry with John Hardy, who could not have died at the end of a drilling-contest. Most likely the ballad celebrating the prowess of John Hardy gradually, in its earlier making, enhanced that prowess, and, by the natural tendency to a tragic ending, finally sang of his defeat and death.” <sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondly, several accounts of primary sources back up that they could be the same person:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘Upon inquiry by Cox, ex-Gov.&nbsp;McCorkle writes, “You are mistaken when you say John Hardy died from the drilling-contest.”’ <sup>5</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, the drilling contest may not have even happened! This telling of a man whose worth and identity are measured only by his strength, which is then challenged by the advent of steam power, is a story that has endured for over a century. <sup>6</sup> It’s tragic, it’s compelling - in short, it’s everything that is needed for a ballad.</p>
<p>When Cox sent a letter to the Ingersoll-Rand Company (the authority on drills), he received the following reply:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“…it is rather improbable that steam rock-drills were used in the building of the C&amp;O Railroad…” <sup>7</sup></p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="so-who-is-who" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-who-is-who">So… Who is Who?</h3>
<p>In short, we do not really know for certain. It is popularly believed that they are two separate people - John Henry the steel-driller and John Hardy the murderous gambler. However, there is much confusion that still exists around this, especially since there are many different versions of the ballads. The early versions of the ballads themselves mix the lyrics and stanzas around, so it really is hard to be sure.</p>
<p>As for me, I like to think that they are the same person.</p>
